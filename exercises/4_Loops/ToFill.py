#create function exampleThree with one input parameter
#the input is an array of random elemnts

#create function exampleFour with two input parameters
#the first input is an array of numbers, second is a single number
#if an element of the array is divisible by the second parameter without remainder
#add it to the temp array
#if element is either 7 or 12 immediately move out of the loop.
#next operation is to transform each element in temp array to the string element
#return transofrmed elements as an array
#hint: the remainder is calculated through %, i.e 7%2 = 1
